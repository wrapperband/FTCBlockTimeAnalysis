#### Feathercoin Transactions and mining Difficulty  ~4 Days / 5000Blocks  06/07/2017

**Feathercoin - Analysis of Block Time, Difficulty and Transactions quantity and values.**  

**Overview and Conclusions**

The Feathercoin difficulty has increased to an average value of 40, equivalent to a 5 times increase in miners. The hash variations is virtually proportional to previous analysis.

This analysis is a check of blockchain timings and activity. Over  5000 Blocks Hours â€¦ from 2nd to 06/07/2017

The average block time over 4 Days is good at   1:03  mins

The percentage of blocks with transactions was ~40% of blocks. The transfer to fee rate is also higher at  128%

There were 12 minor time anomolies in the blockchain timings for the 5000 min test peroid. 5 of those time anomalies were Blocks with the same time.

**Low Fees**
 
There were 3 low fee anomalies paying 50FTC instead of 80.  

Investigation showed these all to be from one p2pool server. Two of the address were investigated as they appeared to be invalid. Without access to the pool logs it is difficult to give an exact reason, but the current theory is an error handling in p2pool triggered the low fee.

**Feathercoin Block Analysis**

FTC is routinely analysed if there are any concerns. These analysis are stored on Github to use as templates or review historical analysis.

Values of the parameters analysed can be extracted from FTC debug file. The ABE software used to produce sites such as http://explorer.feathercoin.com/chain/Feathercoin?count=1000&hi=1783533 does some of this work for you, so for sporadic analysis of a few days it is convenient to scrape the data from there.

Normally the web site displays up to 100 blocks but this can be expanded manually.

The data is accumulated in a text document, then pasted into the spreadsheet template from the last analysis. Charts and calculations data ranges are corrected as required.

#### Feathercoin Transaction time data analysis charts 06/07/2017 over 5000 Blocks

**Feathercoin Difficulty**   

This chart shows the variation difficulty as the hash rate of different (coin switching)  pools is directed towards FTC. The red chart is seen to vary cyclically  at about 15 minutes.

The blue raising line is the block against time. The less variation in has, the straighter this line will be, so it is an indicator of how much the difficulty calculator (eHRC) is being stressed.

Comparing this to previous charts the average difficulty, and the rate and frequency of variation have increased. It looks like there are more switching pools forming some more complex time signature patterns.

**Feathercoin Block Times**  

In this chart the green lines show the actual block times. In this case there was one high block times > 10 mins, and there were more block times > 10 mins than usually seen.

#### Analysis of High Difficulty

The highest difficulty / Hash rate directed at Feathercoin Blockchain was at around 2:30 am GMT 06/07/2017

This chart shows the surrounding 4 hour period zoomed in. It can be seen that eHRC reacts and increases the Difficulty. 

The slope of Blocks blue line shows the level of "attack". The straighter the line the less adjustment of the difficulty has to take place to maintain the 1 minute block times.

The chart show vertical lines where each of the blocks would have occurred optimally.

The highest difficulty / Hash rate directed at Feathercoin Blockchain was at around 2:30 am GMT 06/07/2017

This chart shows the surrounding 4 hour period zoomed in. It can be seen how the block times are affected and how eHRC tries to maintain one minute intervals.

The red line shows the average been pushed up to ~1:10 secs for the period.

This chart shows the value of transactions for the period of high difficulty. There appeared to be a "low to normal" level of transactions. It can be seen there are some high value transactions not strictly associated with the high difficulty.
