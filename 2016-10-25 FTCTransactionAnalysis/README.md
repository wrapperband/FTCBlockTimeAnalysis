@wrapper **Feathercoin - Analysis of attempted, maximum Transactions block attack / Dustcoin settings probe - 25/10/2016**

**Overview and Conclusions**

This analysis is a investigation of FTC blockchain timings and activity. Over  24 Hours â€¦ from 25/10/2016, triggered by a transaction number peak level on that day.

The high level of transactions on 25/10/2017 were analysed. In can be seen there are multiple attempts to spent thousands of dust coins. The number of transactions maxed out per block at 1100. This would need re-testeing on the test network, but the max transaction per block seen, is probably a function of the dust coin script that was run and fund limits.

The dustcoin event started at 3:00pm 25/10/2016 and ended at 21:00pm 25/10/2016. It effected blocks 1439149 to 1439500.


The average block time over 24hrs is bad at 2:00

The charts are showing a positive increase in transactions / transaction values / amounts and baseline mining over the previous analysis.
The percentage of blocks with transactions has increase compared to previous analysis, up  to 34% of block from 25%. The transfer to fee rate is up at 9%.
Transactions less fees also show a positive increase.

**Feathercoin Difficulty**   

This chart shows the variation difficulty as the hash rate of different (coin switching)  pools is directed a FTC. The red chart is seen to vary cyclicly at about 15 minutes.

The blue raising line is the block against time. The less variation in has, the straighter this line will be, so it is an indicator of how much the difficulty calculator (eHRC) is being stressed.

**Feathercoin Block Times**  

In this chart the green lines show the actual block times. In this case there were no very high block times > 10 mins, but there were more block times > 8 mins than usual.

**Feathercoin Number of Transactions - Unscaled**   

This is a new chart to analyse the high level of transactions on 25/10/2017. In can be seen there are multiple attempts to spent thousands of dust coins. The number of transactions maxed out per block at 1100. The size of an extracted csv file of 24 hours data was 25 MB, hinting a a possible test of transaction limits.
This would need re testeing on the test network, as the max transaction per block seen, it may be a function of the dust coin script that was run.

**Feathercoin Block Time Average 110 Blocks 26/10/2016**   

The average block time for the 24 hrs was (anomously) high, possibly due to difficulties averaging time. To confirm / check that a chart of the block time averaged was OK, a new chart was created averaged over 10 blocks.
