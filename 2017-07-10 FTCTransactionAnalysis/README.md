### Feathercoin Transactions and mining Difficulty  3pm to 10 am UK - 1000Blocks  10/07/2017

**Feathercoin - Analysis of Block Time, Difficulty and Transactions quantity and values.**  

**Overview and Conclusions**

The Feathercoin difficulty has increased to an average value of 40, equivalent to a 5 times increase in miners. The hash variations is virtually proportional to previous analysis.

This analysis is a check of blockchain timings and activity. Over  1000 Blocks  â€¦ from 9th to 10/07/2017

The average block time over 1000 Blocks is good at   1:03  mins

The percentage of blocks with transactions was ~40% of blocks. The transfer to fee rate is also higher than 1% normal at  3% of Value transfered

There were 4 minor time anomolies in the blockchain timings for the 1000 min test peroid. 3 of those time anomalies were Blocks with the same time.

**Low Fees**
 
There were 2 low fee anomalies paying 50FTC instead of 80.  

The halving happened correctly to 40 FTC per block.


**Feathercoin Block Analysis**

FTC is routinely analysed if there are any concerns. These analysis are stored on Github to use as templates or review historical analysis.

Values of the parameters analysed can be extracted from FTC debug file. The ABE software used to produce sites such as http://explorer.feathercoin.com/chain/Feathercoin?count=1000&hi=1783533 does some of this work for you, so for sporadic analysis of a few days it is convenient to scrape the data from there.

Normally the web site displays up to 100 blocks but this can be expanded manually.

The data is accumulated in a text document, then pasted into the spreadsheet template from the last analysis. Charts and calculations data ranges are corrected as required.


**Overview of the 1000 min period up to 10/07/2017**

**FTC Fees over 1000 Blocks**   80000   
**Transactions less fees**		2.9M FTC   
3 %	**Fee to Transaction volume ratio**	    
**Percentage  Blocks with Transaction**	37.2%	 
**Average Block Time 4 days**    1:03 mins    



#### Feathercoin Transaction time data analysis charts 10/07/2017 over 1000 Blocks

**Feathercoin Difficulty**   

This chart shows the variation difficulty as the hash rate of different (coin switching)  pools is directed towards FTC. The red chart is seen to vary cyclically  at about 15 minutes.

The blue raising line is the block against time. The less variation in has, the straighter this line will be, so it is an indicator of how much the difficulty calculator (eHRC) is being stressed.

Comparing this to previous charts the average difficulty, and the rate and frequency of variation have increased. It looks like there are more switching pools forming some more complex time signature patterns.

**Feathercoin Block Times**  

In this chart the green lines show the actual block times. In this case there was one high block times > 10 mins, and there were more block times > 10 mins than usually seen.
