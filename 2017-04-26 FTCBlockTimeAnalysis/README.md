#### Feathercoin Difficulty & Block Time Analysis  26-4-2017

A high level of difficulty was reported for 26/4/2017. Iâ€™ve done an examination of the Feathercoin Transaction Blocks Difficulty calculation over 1700 blocks. 

**Results:**
* Number of Blocks analyzed	1704  
* Fees	135,920	FTC  
* Transactions less fees		1,581,801.70 FTC	  
* Transaction to Fee ratio	11.64   Times  
* Percentage with Transaction	24.71 %  
* Number of Blocks with Transactions	421   

The analysis was from Block   1688676	on 2017-04-25 15:50:30  to 1690375   at	2017-04-26 21:47:00 .

The result show the effect on block times as eHRC kicks in. Peak difficulty was 40.  The average block time remained 1.03 minutes, which is not bad considering the high hash.

The high hash rate events are approximately 50 - 100 block long, then repeated every 200 blocks.

It can be seen that the later events show quicker rates of difficulty increases, as the effect of the earlier event is within the recalculation range. This explains why later events left the longest block time of 18 mins.

It is not ideal to have such swings and FTC hasn't seen such changes since ASIC days when a Litecoin pools could switch hashing to FTC.

The charts show the difficulty and Block time over a day and then close up of the largest event over 200 blocks.
