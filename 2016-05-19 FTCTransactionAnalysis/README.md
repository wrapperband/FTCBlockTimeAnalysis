# FTC Block Time Analysis due to increase in Hash Rate 19th to 21st /05/2016

@Wrapper  I've  gone back to review the 19th March as well as the 20th March as they both had high hash rates.

This chart shows the last 100 mins before midnight where there is a the large variation in Hash. Ideally the blue line should be straight diagonal.

If the line is flattened, that is because the hash rate has reduced and it is taking longer to get a block.

The worse possibility is "The Wall"   that is, a big hash rig coming in and picking up FTC at a difficulty set for smaller rigs. In this worse case scenario, the background network is a 500 MHAsh/sec and that is being increase to 1 GHash/s during Hash switches an example at midnight.

If high hash variation continues, we should consider removing difficulty damping, it should not just need a soft fork, which could be a "upgrade vote" triggered soft fork. However, a doubling of the baseling hash rate to 10 difficulty would start to ease the strain on eHRC, and reduce the need.
