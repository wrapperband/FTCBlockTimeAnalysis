**Feathercoin Difficulty**   

This chart shows the variation difficulty as the hash rate of different (coin switching)  pools is directed a FTC. The red chart is seen to vary cyclicly at about 15 minutes.

The blue raising line is the block against time. The less variation in has, the straighter this line will be, so it is an indicator of how much the difficulty calculator (eHRC) is being stressed.

**Feathercoin Number of Transactions - Unscaled**   

This is a new chart to analyse the high level of transactions on 25/10/2017. In can be seen there are multiple attempts to spent thousands of dust coins. The number of transactions maxed out per block at 1100. The size of an extracted csv file of 24 hours data was 25 MB, hinting a a possible test of transaction limits.
This would need re testeing on the test network, as the max transaction per block seen, it may be a function of the dust coin script that was run.

**Feathercoin Block Time Average 110 Blocks 26/10/2016**   

The average block time for the 24 hrs was (anomously) high, possibly due to difficulties averaging time. To confirm / check that a chart of the block time averaged was OK, a new chart was created averaged over 10 blocks.
