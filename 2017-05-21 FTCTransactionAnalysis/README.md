**Feathercoin Difficulty**   

This chart shows the variation difficulty as the hash rate of different (coin switching)  pools is directed towards FTC. The red chart is seen to vary cyclically  at about 15 minutes.

The blue raising line is the block against time. The less variation in has, the straighter this line will be, so it is an indicator of how much the difficulty calculator (eHRC) is being stressed.

Comparing this to previous charts the average difficulty, and the rate and frequency of variation have increased. It looks like there are more switching pools forming some more complex time signature paterns.

**Feathercoin Block Time Average 110 Blocks 26/10/2016**   

The average block time for the 24 hrs was (anomously) high, possibly due to difficulties averaging time. To confirm / check that a chart of the block time averaged was OK, a new chart was created averaged over 10 blocks.
